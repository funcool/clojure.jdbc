== Introduction

_clojure.jdbc_ is a library for low level, jdbc-based database access.


link:api/index.html[Api reference documentation.]


=== Install

The simplest way to use _clojure.jdbc_ in a clojure project, is by including it in the dependency
vector on your *_project.clj_* file:

[source,clojure]
----
[funcool/clojure.jdbc "0.9.0"]
----

You also need to add an entry for the java driver that you need. For instance, for `mysql`:

[source, clojure]
---
[mysql/mysql-connector-java "5.1.6"]
---

The project is tested under JDK7 and JDK8.


=== Project Maturity

Since _clojure.jdbc_ is a young project there may be some API breakage.


== User Guide

=== Connecting to database

This section intends to explain everything that you should to know about how
connect to the database.


==== Connection parameters

JDBC is the default Java abstraction/interface for SQL databases.  It's like
the Python DB-API and similar abstractions in other languages.  Clojure, as a
guest language on the JVM, benefits from having a good, well-tested abstraction
like that.

Connection parameters are exposed in a simple hash-map and called *dbspec*. This is the simplest
and most idiomatic way in Clojure to define configuration parameters.

.This is a default aspect of one dbspec.
[source,clojure]
----
(def dbspec {:subprotocol "postgresql"
             :subname "//localhost:5432/dbname"
             :user "username"         ;; Optional
             :password "password"}    ;; Optional
----

Also, _clojure.jdbc_ comes with alternative, more human comprehensible format, like this:

.Pretty dbspec format
[source, clojure]
----
(def dbspec {:vendor "postgresql"
             :name "dbname"
             :host "localhost"      ;; Optional
             :port 5432             ;; Optional
             :user "username"       ;; Optional
             :password "password"}) ;; Optional
----

But it has some disadvantages: it does not supports all options of a default dbspec format.

Also, *dbspec* can be represented as a URI.

.Same as the previous example but using URI format.
[source,clojure]
----
(def dbspec "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname")
----

==== Creating a connection

With _clojure.jdbc_ every function that interacts with a database explicitly requires
one connection instance as parameter (no dynamic vars are used for it).

.Create one connection using `connection` function:
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[jdbc.core :as jdbc])

(let [conn (jdbc/connection dbspec)]
  (do-something-with conn)
  (.close conn))
----

As you can see in previous example, you should explicltly close connection for proper
resource management. You can use the `with-open` clojure macro for make code looks
more clean and idiomatic.

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [conn (jdbc/connection dbspec)]
  (do-something-with conn))
----


=== Execute Database Commands

==== Execute Raw SQL Statements

The simplest way to execute raw SQL is using the `execute` function. It requires
an active connection as the first parameter followed by SQL sentence:

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [conn (jdbc/connection dbspec)]
  (jdbc/execute conn "CREATE TABLE foo (id serial, name text);"))
----


==== Execute Parametrized SQL Statements

Raw SQL statements work well for creating tables and similar operations, but
when you need to insert some data, especially if the data comes from untrusted
sources. Using plain string concatenation is a very bat and unsafe approach.

For safe parameter bindings, it there a *sqlvec* format that consists in a
vector with sql followed of parameters:

.Example of sqlvec format
[source,clojure]
----
["select * from foo where age < ?" 20]
----

Almost all functions in _clojure.jdbc_ accepts sqlvec as query parameter.
Let see an example using it in `execute` function:

.Execute a simple insert SQL statement.
[source,clojure]
----
(jdbc/execute conn ["insert into foo (name) values (?);" "Foo"]))
----


==== Returning Inserted Keys

In some circumstances, you want to use the "RETURNING id" or similar functionality on
your queries for getting the primary keys of newly inserted records.

.Example executing query with "returning" statement
[source, clojure]
----
(let [sql "insert into foo (name) values (?) returning id;"
      res (jdbc/fetch conn [sql "Foo"])]
  (println res))

;; This should print something like this to standard output:
[{:id 3}]
----


=== Make Queries

It is time to start executing queries and fetch results. For this purpose,
_clojure.jdbc_ exposes the `fetch` function:

[source,clojure]
----
(let [sql    ["SELECT id, name FROM people WHERE age > ?", 2]
      result (jdbc/fetch conn sql)]
  (doseq [row result]
    (println row))))

;; It should print somthing like this:
;; => {:id 1 :name "Foo"}
;; => {:id 2 :name "Bar"}
----

We are know that almost all function in _clojure.jdbc_ accepts a plain
sql and sqlvec as query parameter. But is not entirely true, it also
accepts as query parameter an instance of self crafted `PreparedStatement`
or anythig that implements the `ISQLStatement` protocol.

.Example creating a prepared statement and executing it
[source, clojure]
----
(let [stmt (jdbc/prepared-statement ["SELECT id, name FROM people WHERE age > ?", 2])
      result (jdbc/fetch conn stmt)]
  (println "Result: " result))
----

[NOTE]
====
The `fetch` method seems useful in most cases but may not work well with
queries that returns a lot of results. For this purpose, cursor type queries exist
that are explained in the xref:cursor-queries[Advanced usage] section.
====


=== Transactions


==== Getting Started with Transactions

The most idiomatic way to wrap some code in a transaction, is by using the `atomic`
macro:

[source,clojure]
----
(jdbc/atomic conn
  (do-thing-first conn)
  (do-thing-second conn))
----

[NOTE]
====
_clojure.jdbc_ does not uses any dynamic thread-local vars to store the transaction state
of a connection. Instead of that, it overwrites the lexical scope value of `conn` with a new
connection that has transactional state.
====


==== Low-level Transaction Primitives

Behind the scenes of the `atomic` macro, _clojure.jdbc_ uses the `atomic-apply` function.

Given an active connection as the first parameter and function that you want execute in a
transaction as the second parameter, it executes the function inside a database transaction.
The callback function should accept a connection as its first parameter.

.Example executing a function in transaction context
[source,clojure]
----
(jdbc/atomic-apply conn
  (fn [conn]
    (do-something-with conn)))
----

[NOTE]
====
_clojure.jdbc_, in contrast to java.jdbc, handles nested transactions well. Thus making all
code wrapped in transaction blocks truly atomic independently of transaction nesting.

If you want extend or change a default transaction strategy, see
xref:transaction-strategy[Transaction Strategy section].
====


==== Isolation Level

_clojure.jdbc_ by default does nothing with the isolation level and keeps it to default values.

.You can set the isolation level when creating a connection by specifying it in your dbspec.
[source,clojure]
----
(def dbspec {:subprotocol "h2"
             :subname "mem:"
             :isolation-level :serializable})

(with-open [conn (jdbc/connection dbspec)]
  ;; The just created connection has the isolation
  ;; level set to :serializable
  (do-things conn))
----

An other way to set the isolation level is in moment of declaring a transaction, using
the `atomic-apply` function or `atomic` macro:

[source, clojure]
----
(jdbc/atomic-apply conn do-something {:isolation-level :serializable})

(jdbc/atomic conn {:isolation-level :serializable}
  (do-something conn))
----

This is a list of supported options:

- `:read-uncommitted` - Set read uncommitted isolation level
- `:read-committed` - Set read committed isolation level
- `:repeatable-read` - Set repeatable reads isolation level
- `:serializable` - Set serializable isolation level
- `:none` - Use this option to indicate to _clojure.jdbc_ to do nothing and keep default behavior.

You can read more about it on link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)[wikipedia].

WARNING: not all JDBC providers support the above isolation levels.


==== Read-Only Transactions

In some circumstances, mainly when you are using the strictest isolation-level, you may want
to indicate to database that a query is actually read-only, allowing the database server to make some
optimizations for this operation.

.You can set transaction read-only using transaction options
[source, clojure]
----
(jdbc/atomic conn {:isolation-level :serializable
                   :read-only true}
  (query-something conn))
----


== Advanced usage

[[cursor-queries]]
=== Server Side Cursors

By default, most JDBC drivers prefetch all results into memory make the use of lazy structures
totally useless for fetching data. Luckily, some databases implement server-side cursors that avoid
this behavior.

If you have an extremely large resultset and you want retrieve it and process each item, this is
exactly what you need.

For this purpose, _clojure.jdbc_ exposes the `fetch-lazy` function, that returns a some kind of
cursor instance. At the moment of creating cursor, no query is executed.

The cursor can be used converting it into clojure lazyseq using `cursor->lazyseq` function:

[source,clojure]
----
(jdbc/atomic conn
  (with-open [cursor (jdbc/fetch-lazy conn "SELECT id, name FROM people;")]
    (doseq [row (jdbc/cursor->lazyseq cursor)]
      (println row)))
----

In some databases, it requires that cursor should be evaluated in a context of one
transaction.


[[transaction-strategy]]
Transaction Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transaction strategies in _clojure.jdbc_ are implemented using protocols having default
implementation explained in the previous sections. This approach allows an easy way to extend,
customize or completely change a transaction strategy for your application.

If you want another strategy, you should create a new type and implement the
`ITransactionStrategy` protocol.

.Sample dummy transaction strategy.
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[jdbc.proto :as proto])

(def dummy-tx-strategy
  (reify
    proto/ITransactionStrategy
    (begin! [_ conn opts] conn)
    (rollback! [_ conn opts] conn)
    (commit! [_ conn opts] conn)))
----


_clojure.jdbc_ has different ways to specify that transaction strategy shouldbe used. The most
common is setting it in your dbspec:

[source,clojure]
----
(def dbspec {:subprotocol "postgresql"
             :subname "//localhost:5432/dbname"
             :tx-strategy dummy-tx-strategy})
(with-open [conn (jdbc/connection dbspec)]
  (jdbc/atomic conn
    ;; In this transaction block, the dummy transaction
    ;; strategy will be used.
    (do-somthing conn)))
----

Internally, _clojure.jdbc_ maintains an instance of default transaction strategy stored
in a dynamic var. You can use the clojure facilities for alter that var for set
an other default transaction stragegy:

.Overwritting with `alter-var-root`
[source, clojure]
----
(alter-var-root #'jdbc/*default-tx-strategy* (fn [_] dummy-tx-strategy))
----

.Overwritting it with dynamic scope
[source, clojure]
----
(binding [jdbc/*default-tx-strategy* dummy-tx-strategy]
  (some-func-that-uses-transactions))
----


=== Extend SQL Types

If you want to extend some type/class to use it as JDBC parameter without explicit conversion
to an SQL-compatible type, you should extend your type with the `jdbc.proto/ISQLType` protocol.

Here is an example which extends Java's String[] (string array) in order to pass it as
a query parameter that corresponds to PostgreSQL text array in the database:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[jdbc.proto :as proto])

(extend-protocol ISQLType
  ;; Obtain a class for string array
  (class (into-array String []))

  (set-stmt-parameter! [this conn stmt index]
    (let [value (proto/as-sql-type this conn)
          array (.createArrayOf conn "text" value)]
      (.setArray stmt index array)))

  (as-sql-type [this conn] this))
----

In this way you can pass a string array as a JDBC parameter that is automatically converted
to an SQL array and assigned properly in a prepared statement:

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [conn (jdbc/connection pg-dbspec)]
  (jdbc/execute conn "CREATE TABLE arrayfoo (id integer, data text[]);")
  (let [mystringarray (into-array String ["foo" "bar"])]
    (jdbc/execute conn ["INSERT INTO arrayfoo VALUES (?, ?);" 1 mystringarray])))
----

_clojure.jdbc_ also exposes the `jdbc.proto/ISQLResultSetReadColumn` protocol that encapsulates
reverse conversions from SQL types to user-defined types.

You can read more about that in this blog post: http://www.niwi.be/2014/04/13/postgresql-json-field-with-clojure-and-jdbc/


[[connection-pool]]
== Connection pool

DataSource is the preferd way to connect to the database in production enviroments, and
is usually used for implement connection pools.

To make good use of resourses is much recommendable use some kind of connection pool
implementation. This can avoid continuosly creating and destroying connections,
that in the majority of time is a slow operation.

Java ecosystem comes with various of it. This is a list of most used:

- HikariCP: https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP
- c3p0: http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/
- Apache DBCP2: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/

_clojure.jdbc_ is compatible with any other connection pool implemenetation, simply
pass a `javax.sql.DataSource` instance to `jdbc/connection` function.


=== c3p0

c3p0, a mature, highly concurrent JDBC connection pooling library for clojure.jdbc.

.Dependency entry
[source, clojure]
----
[com.mchange/c3p0 "0.9.5"]
----

In order to use this connection pool, previously you should create a DataSource instance. Here
an little example on how it can be done:

[source, clojure]
----
(import 'com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource)

(def ds (doto (ComboPooledDataSource.)
          (.setJdbcUrl (str "jdbc:"
                            (:subprotocol dbspec)
                            ":"
                            (:subname dbspec)))
          (.setUser (:user dbspec nil))
          (.setPassword (:password dbspec nil))

          ;; Pool Size Management
          (.setMinPoolSize 3)
          (.setMaxPoolSize 15)

          ;; Connection eviction
          (.setMaxConnectionAge  3600) ; 1 hour
          (.setMaxIdleTime 1800)       ; 1/2 hour
          (.setMaxIdleTimeExcessConnections 120)

          ;; Connection testing
          (.setTestConnectionOnCheckin false)
          (.setTestConnectionOnCheckout false)
          (.setIdleConnectionTestPeriod 600)))
----

You can found all configuration parameters here: http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#configuration

Now, the new created datasource should be used like a plain dbspec for creating connections:

(with-open [conn (jdbc/connection ds)]
  (do-stuff conn))
----

(import 'org.apache.commons.dbcp2.BasicDataSource)

(def ds (doto (BasicDataSource.)
          (.setJdbcUrl (str "jdbc:"

          ;; Connection testing
          (.setTestOnBorrow false)
          (.setTestOnReturn false)
          (.setTestWhileIdle true)

== FAQ

=== Why another JDBC wrapper?

This is an incomplete list of reasons:

- Connection management in _clojure.jdbc_ is simple and explicit. However, java.jdbc does not make
  diferentiation between a connection or dbspec hash map. At first glace it seems more flexible,
  but it requires huge additional complexity and boilerplate code on each function that receives
  a connection. If you are curious, take a look at the `with-db-connection` implementation of
  java.jdbc and compare it with *clojure.jdbc*: it will get you a good idea of the hidden and
  unnecessary complexity found in java.jdbc.
- _clojure.jdbc_ comes with proper transaction management with full support for nested transactions,
  and plugable transaction strategies. In contrast, java.jdbc comes with one unique strategy, that
  does not support subtransactions (it flattens all nested transactions in one unique giving you
  false security when you wraps you code in a transaction).
- _clojure.jdbc_ has native support for connection pools.
- _clojure.jdbc_ has first class documentation.
- _clojure.jdbc_ has a simpler implementation than java.jdbc without unnecesary code duplication. A
  good example are the crud methods of java.jdbc: all them repeats the transaction logic implicitly.
  In contrast, clojure.jdbc, if you want a transaction, you should wrap your code in a transaction
  context explicitly.


=== Does _clojure.jdbc_ have better performance than java.jdbc?

Mostly **Yes**, _clojure.jdbc_  by default has better performance than java.jdbc. You can
run the micro benchmark code in your environment with: `lein with-profile bench run`

In my environments, the results are:

[source,text]
----

clojure.jdbc:
"Elapsed time: 602.482932 msecs"
----


=== Why does _clojure.jdbc_ not include a DSL for working with SQL as java.jdbc 0.3 does?

_clojure.jdbc_ is a wrapper for the Java JDBC interface. It doesn't intend to provide helpers
to avoid SQL usage. There are already plenty of DSLs for working with SQL.
_clojure.jdbc_ will not reinvent the wheel.

This is an incomplete list of Clojure DSLs for SQL:

- https://github.com/niwibe/suricatta
- https://github.com/stch-library/sql
- https://github.com/r0man/sqlingvo
- https://github.com/jkk/honeysql


=== Is this a fork of java.jdbc?

No. It is an alternative implementation.

== Developers Guide

=== Philosophy

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _clojure.jdbc_ should keep these important rules in mind.
